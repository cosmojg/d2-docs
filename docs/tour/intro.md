# D2 Tour

```d2
direction: right
x -> y -> z: onwards!
```

**D2** is a diagram scripting language that turns text to diagrams. It stands for
**Declarative Diagramming**. Declarative, as in, you describe what you want diagrammed, it
generates the image.

For example, you provide this input on the left, and you get back the output on the right.
<img src={require('@site/static/img/screenshots/intro-example.png').default}
alt="declarative diagramming example"/>

CLI example
<img width="100%" src={require('@site/static/img/screenshots/cli.gif').default}
alt="D2 CLI"/>

You can finish this tour in about 5-10 minutes, and at the end, there's a cheat sheet you
can download and refer to. If you want just the bare essentials, <a
href="/tour/hello-world">Getting Started</a> takes
~2 mins.
